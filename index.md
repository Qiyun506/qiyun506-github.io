## WELCOME to Qiyun's World! :)

"Qiyun was, is, and will be a **great programmer** ！"

Favorite lanugage: JAVA! ~~But when writing leetcode,python seems better~~

However I still believe that

> Java™ has significant advantages over other languages

I also find another useful stuff: **GIT**：

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
some useful flags like:
```
git checkbranch -b XXX
git commit -m XXX
```

Ok so here is my [resume](https://resume.io/r/kIa5ISfnf)

and this is my best friend's Cat!

For me, I like:
- Boxing
- Piano
- surfing
- E-games！

To be a good programmer, I still need those classes:
- [x] software 
- [x] data mining
- [ ] data base
- [ ] ML
- [ ] hardware
- [ ] To be continue...
